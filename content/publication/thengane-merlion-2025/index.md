abstract: Autonomous and targeted underwater visual monitoring and exploration using
  Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) can be a challenging task due to both online
  and offline constraints. The online constraints comprise limited onboard storage
  capacity and communication bandwidth to the surface, whereas the offline constraints
  entail the time and effort required for the selection of desired keyframes from
  the video data. An example use case of targeted underwater visual monitoring is
  finding the most interesting visual frames of fish in a long sequence of an AUV’s
  visual experience. This challenge of targeted informative sampling is further aggravated
  in murky waters with poor visibility. In this paper, we present MERLION, a novel
  framework that provides semantically aligned and visually enhanced summaries for
  murky underwater marine environment monitoring and exploration. Specifically, our
  framework integrates (a) an image-text model for semantically aligning the visual
  samples to the user’s needs, (b) an image enhancement model for murky water visual
  data and (c) an informative sampler for summarizing the monitoring experience. We
  validate our proposed MERLION framework on real-world data with user studies and
  present qualitative and quantitative results using our evaluation metric and show
  improved results compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. We have open-sourced
  the code for MERLION at the following link https://github.com/MARVL-Lab/MERLION.git.
