 abstract = {The increasing demand for autonomous vehicles has created a need for robust navigation systems that can also operate effectively in adverse weather conditions. Visual odometry is a technique used in these navigation systems, enabling the estimation of vehicle position and motion using input from onboard cameras. However, visual odometry accuracy can be significantly impacted in challenging weather conditions, such as heavy rain, snow, or fog. In this paper, we evaluate a range of visual odometry methods, including our DROIDSLAM based heuristic approach. Specifically, these algorithms are tested on both clear and rainy weather urban driving data to evaluate their robustness. We compiled a dataset comprising of a range of rainy weather conditions from different cities. This includes, the Oxford Robotcar dataset from Oxford, the 4Seasons dataset from Munich and an internal dataset collected in Singapore. We evaluated different visual odometry algorithms for both monocular and stereo camera setups using the Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE). Our evaluation suggests that the Depth and Flow for Visual Odometry (DF-VO) algorithm with monocular setup worked well for short range distances (\textless 500ùëö) and our proposed DROID-SLAM based heuristic approach for the stereo setup performed relatively well for long-term localization. Both algorithms performed consistently well across all rain conditions.},
