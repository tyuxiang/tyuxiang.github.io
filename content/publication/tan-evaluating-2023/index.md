abstract: The increasing demand for autonomous vehicles has created a need for robust
  navigation systems that can also operate effectively in adverse weather conditions.
  Visual odometry is a technique used in these navigation systems, enabling the estimation
  of vehicle position and motion using input from onboard cameras. However, visual
  odometry accuracy can be significantly impacted in challenging weather conditions,
  such as heavy rain, snow, or fog. In this paper, we evaluate a range of visual odometry
  methods, including our DROIDSLAM based heuristic approach. Specifically, these algorithms
  are tested on both clear and rainy weather urban driving data to evaluate their
  robustness. We compiled a dataset comprising of a range of rainy weather conditions
  from different cities. This includes, the Oxford Robotcar dataset from Oxford, the
  4Seasons dataset from Munich and an internal dataset collected in Singapore. We
  evaluated different visual odometry algorithms for both monocular and stereo camera
  setups using the Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE). Our evaluation suggests that the
  Depth and Flow for Visual Odometry (DF-VO) algorithm with monocular setup worked
  well for short range distances (textless 500ùëö) and our proposed DROID-SLAM based
  heuristic approach for the stereo setup performed relatively well for long-term
  localization. Both algorithms performed consistently well across all rain conditions.
