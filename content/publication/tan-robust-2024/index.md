abstract: GPS-based vehicle localization and tracking suffers from unstable positional
  information commonly experienced in tunnel segments and in dense urban areas. Also,
  both Visual Odometry (VO) and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) are susceptible to
  adverse weather conditions that causes occlusions or blur on the visual input. In
  this paper, we propose a novel approach for vehicle localization that uses street
  network based map information to correct drifting odometry estimates and intermittent
  GPS measurements especially, in adversarial scenarios such as driving in rain and
  tunnels. Specifically, our approach is a flexible fusion algorithm that integrates
  intermittent GPS, drifting IMU and VO estimates together with 2D map information
  for robust vehicle localization and tracking. We refer to our approach as Map-Fusion.
  We robustly evaluate our proposed approach on four geographically diverse datasets
  from different countries ranging across clear and rain weather conditions. These
  datasets also include challenging visual segments in tunnels and underpasses. We
  show that with the integration of the map information, our Map-Fusion algorithm
  reduces the error of the state-of-the-art VO and VIO approaches across all datasets.
  We also validate our proposed algorithm in a real-world environment and in real-time
  on a hardware constrained mobile robot. Map-Fusion achieved 2.46m error in clear
  weather and 6.05m error in rain weather for a 150 m route.
