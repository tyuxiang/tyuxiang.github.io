abstract: This paper presents a localization algorithm for autonomous urban vehicles
  under rain weather conditions. In adverse weather, human drivers anticipate the
  location of the ego-vehicle based on the control inputs they provide and surrounding
  road contextual information. Similarly, in our approach for localization in rain
  weather, we use visual data, along with a global reference path and vehicle motion
  model for anticipating and better estimating the pose of the ego-vehicle in each
  frame. The global reference path contains useful road contextual information such
  as the angle of turn which can be potentially used to improve the localization accuracy
  especially when sensors are compromised. We experimented on the Oxford Robotcar
  Dataset and our internal dataset from Singapore to validate our localization algorithm
  in both clear and rain weather conditions. Our method improves localization accuracy
  by 50.83% in rain weather and 34.32% in clear weather when compared to baseline
  algorithms.
