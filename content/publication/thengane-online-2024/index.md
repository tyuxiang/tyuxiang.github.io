abstract: The underwater world remains largely unexplored, with Autonomous Underwater
  Vehicles (AUVs) playing a crucial role in sub-sea explorations. However, continuous
  monitoring of underwater environments using AUV s can generate a sig-nificant amount
  of data. In addition, sending live data feed from an underwater environment requires
  dedicated on-board data storage options for AUV s which can hinder requirements
  of other higher priority tasks. Informative sampling techniques offer a solution
  by condensing observations. In this paper, we present a semantically-aware online
  informative sampling (ON- IS) approach which samples an AUV's visual experience
  in real- time. Specifically, we obtain visual features from a fine-tuned object
  detection model to align the sampling outcomes with the desired semantic information.
  Our contributions are (a) a novel Semantic Online Informative Sampling (SON-IS)
  algorithm, (b) a user study to validate the proposed approach and (c) a novel evaluation
  metric to score our proposed algorithm with respect to the suggested samples by
  human subjects.
